She Codes Python Project Turtles
There are two working files part_1.py and part_1_me.py.
part_1.py is where I have tried to work with the framework provided to complete the assignment.
part_1_me.py is where I have tried to reinterpet the assignment in a framework similar to step by step instructions, please refer to this document as my main attempt.

Where I have come unstuck:
    - I am struggling with returning the data at the end of my function so I can then use it in the next sections.
    - Understanding how to call that data into something elses to then use it in another funtion.
    - My overall understanding of python is still developing and I can complete small exercises where I know what we are expected to use to create the desired output but where there is a variety of ways to do things I struggle knowing which path to take.

I look forward to your feedback and maybe to see an example of how this assignment should be completed.
